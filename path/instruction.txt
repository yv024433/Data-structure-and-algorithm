Use the Graph class, and Path interface provided on the unit web-page to implement solutions to the minimum spanning tree problem (for wighted undirected graphs) and the single source shortest path problem (for weighted directed graphs). Write a class PathImp that implements Path.
Your implementation of getMinimumSpanningTree should return the weight of the minimum spanning tree, or -1 if no minimum spanning tree can be found.
Your implementation of getShortestPaths(G, v) should use Djikstraâ€™s algorithm to return an array of the distances from the specified start vertex to each of the vertices in the graph.
To help you test your code, a class PathTest is provided. It should give something similar to the output:
